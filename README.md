# XMC&trade; MCU: Analog comparator

This code example demonstrates the usage of the analog comparator (ACMP) peripheral of XMC&trade; MCU.

The comparator block (ANACMP-1) is configured to receive a divided reference voltage on the positive input (IN-P) pin. You can then modify the voltage to the negative input (IN-N) pin (Port 2.6) and watch the user LED toggle according to the change in ANACMP1:CMP_OUT.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details open><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details open><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

 Argument          | Description       | Required/optional
 ----------------- | ----------------- | -----------------
 `--board-id`      | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest     | Required
 `--app-id`        | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest     | Required
 `--target-dir`    | Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
 `--user-app-name` | Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name                | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[Analog Comparator](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-xmc-acmp-cmp)" application with the desired name "acmp" configured for the *KIT_XMC14_BOOT_001* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC14_BOOT_001 --app-id mtb-example-xmc-acmp-cmp --user-app-name acmp --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details open><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

**Note:** Only VS Code is supported.

1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

</details>

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using a micro-USB cable through the debug USB connector.

2. Program the board using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software:

   1. Select the application project in Project Explorer.

   2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (JLink)**.
3. Connect VDD to P2.11 (ACMP_REF pin).

4. Connect GND to P2.6. The LED turns ON.

5. Connect VDD to P2.6. The LED turns OFF.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (JLink)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

This example shows how the ACMP peripheral of the XMC&trade; MCU works. The implementation consists of the following three steps:

1. Selects and configures the ACMP using the `XMC_ACMP_Init()` function.

2. Connects the divided reference 'VACMP_REF/2' to the positive input pin 'ACMP1.INP' by using the `XMC_ACMP_EnableReferenceDivider()` function.

3. Enables the ACMP by using the `XMC_ACMP_EnableComparator()` function.

The LED is toggled based on the reading of the comparator output and modifying the negative input pin (IN-N).
